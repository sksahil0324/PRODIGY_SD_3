# Contact Manager

A simple GUI-based program to manage contact information. This program allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. Contacts are stored persistently in a JSON file, ensuring data is saved even after the program is closed.

---

## Features

- **Add Contact:** Enter the name, phone number, and email address to create a new contact.
- **View Contacts:** See a list of all saved contacts.
- **Edit Contact:** Update the details of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact:** Remove unwanted contacts from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Contacts are saved in a `contacts.json` file for future use.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `contact_manager.py` file.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python contact_manager.py
   ```
2. Use the graphical interface to:
   - **Add Contact:** Fill in the name, phone number, and email fields, then click `Add Contact`.
   - **Edit Contact:** Select a contact from the list, modify the details, and click `Edit Contact`.
   - **Delete Contact:** Select a contact and click `Delete Contact`.
   - **Clear Fields:** Reset all input fields for a new entry.

---

## How It Works

- **Contact Storage:** Contacts are stored in a JSON file named `contacts.json`. This ensures all added contacts are available when you reopen the program.
- **List View:** A scrollable list displays all saved contacts. Selecting a contact populates the input fields with its details for easy editing or deletion.
- **Validation:** Ensures all fields are filled before adding or updating a contact.

   - Shows empty input fields and a list of existing contacts.

2. **Adding a Contact:**  
   - Enter `John Doe`, `1234567890`, and `john.doe@example.com`. Click `Add Contact`.

3. **Editing a Contact:**  
   - Select `John Doe` from the list, update the phone number to `9876543210`, and click `Edit Contact`.
